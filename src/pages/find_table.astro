      A MESSAGE FROM THE COMMANDANT OF THE MARINE CORPS
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-10 italic text-left">
      <p class="indent-8">
        For 249 years, Marines have served as our Nation's sentinels of freedom.
        As we celebrate our Corps' birthday this year, I encourage all Marines
        to reflect on our legacy forged in blood on battlefields since 1775, and
        to rededicate ourselves to carrying that legacy untarnished into the
        future. Collectively, we who wear the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor have an
        obligation to uphold the ideals of self-discipline, warfighting
        proficiency, professionalism, and personal conduct that define what it
        means to be a Marine. I know you are all up to the task.
      </p>
      <p class="indent-8">
        Twenty years ago this month, Marines fought and won the Second Battle of
        Fallujah, a brutal, grinding house to house fight, whose victory
        ultimately paved the way for the stabilization of the Republic of Iraq.
        Often in Iraq there were no true front lines, and by necessity, Fallujah
        was a battle in which every Marine fought, demonstrating once again our
        cornerstone philosophy that Every Marine is a Rifleman.
      </p>
      <p class="indent-8">
        Our history bears witness to Marines of all stripes picking up their
        rifles and fighting for Corps and Country when the call came. From Wake
        Island to the Chosin Reservoir to Khe Sanh to Camp Bastion, every Marine
        fought. Our future battles will be no different. Our rear areas will be
        as vulnerable as our front lines and every Marine from our infantry
        battalions to our aviation squadrons to our headquarters and support
        elements will have to stand-to when called.
      </p>
      <p class="indent-8">
        Preparing for the threats of the future requires the same exceptional
        standards and ironclad discipline that are the hallmarks of our Corps.
        Twenty years ago in Fallujah, our predecessors staunchly adhered to
        these virtues, earned our Nation's trust, and ensured the U.S. Marine
        Corps would remain the most feared fighting force in the world. It is
        our sworn duty to uphold those standards and stay true to our Core
        Values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment. Though technology and
        equipment change, the Marine Corps' culture of excellence must not. The
        road ahead is far from certain, but our ethos will never change — Every
        Marine a Rifleman and Everyone Fights.
      </p>
      <p class="indent-8">
        As I've said before, it is the honor of my lifetime to be a Marine and
        serve as your Commandant. I'm proud to stand alongside each of you, and
        I'm excited to see what the future holds for our Corps. When I travel to
        visit Marines here at home and deployed around the globe, I find
        absolute confidence that this generation of Marines has what it takes to
        uphold our Corps' legacy and prevail in any conflict we face. Happy
        Birthday, Marines!
